# Brief
This repo contains the scripts for the app made during the Open AI Whisper Hackathon via lablab.ai by Whisper4Lokal team.
You can view a working impl at https://huggingface.co/spaces/EVad/RememberThis. 

# About
This app takes in a voice recording, transcribe it and extracts the main keyword from the transcribed text. The text and keyword are then stored in a Google Sheet.

# Note
To obtain the Google Sheets API key, head to https://pygsheets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authorization.html. 
The sheetsKey.json contained my API key for Google Sheet.
